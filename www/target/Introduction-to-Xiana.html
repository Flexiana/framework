<h1 id="introduction&#95;to&#95;xiana">Introduction to Xiana</h1><p>TODO: write <a href='http://jacobian.org/writing/what-to-write/'>great documentation</a></p><h2 id="email&#95;configuration">Email configuration</h2><p>Xiana has support for sending email messages. For this functionality to work, a <code>:xiana/emails</code> key has to be added to the application  config e.g. <code>config/dev/config.edn</code>.  <code>:from</code> is a required key. <code>:host :user :pass :tls :port</code> are optional, if they are not present,  the app will default to the mail sender present on the host, but you can use any SMTP of your  choice. </p><p>Full configuration looks like this</p><pre><code class="clojure">:xiana/emails {:host &quot;smtp.some.mail.com&quot;
               :user &quot;john.user&quot;
               :pass &quot;secret@password&quot;
               :tls  true
               :port 587
               :from &quot;System Admin &lt;sysadmin@example.com&gt;&quot;}
</code></pre><h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2><p>The module <code>xiana.hash</code> provides secure Bcrypt, Scrypt and Pbkdf2 hashing for storing user passwords. If you'd like to define some of them, their keys are: <code>:bcrypt :scrypt :pbkdf2</code>. If you don't define one of them, Bcrypt will be defined by default. You can setup the key within <code>config</code> derectory as well as its corresponding optional configuration. The values by default for each algorithm are defined as follows:</p><pre><code class="clojure">:xiana/auth {:hash-algorithm  :bcrypt ;; Available values: :bcrypt, :scrypt, and :pbkdf2
             :bcrypt-settings {:work-factor 11}
             :scrypt-settings {:cpu-cost        32768 ;; Must be a power of 2
                               :memory-cost     8
                               :parallelization 1}
             :pbkdf2-settings {:type       :sha1 ;; Available values: :sha1 and :sha256
                               :iterations 100000}}
</code></pre><p>The module has <code>make</code> (it generate a hashed password) and <code>check</code> (it verifies the encrypted password against the current string) functions to deal with hashing process.</p>
