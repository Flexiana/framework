description: "Xiana - like any other framework - is for helping developers, without using any magic."
lead: "Xiana - like any other framework - is for helping developers, in this case to create web applications. It
provides ready to use solutions for most common use cases. It's like getting prepared and portioned ingredients instead
of you need to peel the carrot to cook a soup. It's lightweight. No hocus-pocus is necessary to spin up the application
and maintain components life cycle, even most of the work is done by the framework. You just define the database query,
and how it should be rendered to sent via API, inject it into the app state and the work is done. You wanna follow the
user activity? Put the data you need into the app state, and it will store it for you. The goal was having an universal
way to sort out everything we faced while working on our inside projects. We're just passing through the application
state, and controlling the application behavior with the content of it."
